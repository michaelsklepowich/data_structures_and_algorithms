# Breadth First Traversal of a Graph

## Setup
This function requires a valid graph as input with nodes that have lists of vertecies

## Logic
From the starting node, mark the node as vistited and add all un-visited nodes to a queue, where the loop continues until the queue is empty. The output is the visited set as it is correctly ordered
